# Modules

### **Theory Crafting bench**

- **Power systems**: Power systems are heavily inspired by the game StarSector, i just always found it sad how we couldn't use the whole flux system for industrial purposes and this is a part of the thing I would like to accomplish with this game.
    - Overdrive Core: Draws power from the reactor to accomodate for a maximum amount of flux. The higher flux is accumulated in the core, the more drain it will have on the reactor.
    - If the flux level reaches maximum the core goes into disassembly mode and will be ejected from the ship unless the overdrive is contained or vented.
    - Most powersystems will be hull modules however the Overdrive Core needs to be managed as an external module to handle venting, containment, and disassembly.
    - Disassembly saves the ship but the sudden exposition to space destroys the void coils within the core.
    - Void coils are fictional story components, they are in-universe sci-fi tech that align atoms of gold, silicon and silver to accelerate flux interacting with their virtual particles drawn from the Void.
